# Image Classifier: Happy or Sad

This repository contains code and resources for an image classifier that uses OpenCV to predict whether a person in a given image is happy or sad. The classifier is built using machine learning techniques and is trained on a labeled dataset of happy and sad facial expressions.

## Introduction

The image classifier in this repository aims to detect and classify the emotional state of a person depicted in an image as either happy or sad. It utilizes OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, along with machine learning techniques to analyze facial expressions and make predictions.

The classifier is trained on a labeled dataset of happy and sad facial expressions, enabling it to learn patterns and features associated with these emotions. It employs image processing algorithms and a trained model to classify new input images.
